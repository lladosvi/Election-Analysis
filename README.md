# Election-Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit: 

The purpose of the election audit was to assess the total election, determine key metrics by county, by candidate and finally determine the overall winner of the election.

## Election-Audit Results: 

1) How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

The total count of votes is 369,711. Some of the code used to create this output shown below:

2) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. Which county had the largest number of votes?

The breakdown by county below:

The county with the largest number of votes is Denver, below is some of the code used to produce this result:

3) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

The breakdown of the metrics by candidate and the winning candidate are below:

## Election-Audit Summary: 

This script can be used or modified to analyze any election results. This one focuses particularly in one candidate level and county level but if a larger election has for example candidates for presidency plus senate, the script can be modified by copying and pasting and changing names the for loops and print statements in this analysis to create a multi layer analysis. In the same way if there were to be more information on a geographic basis like state, city , county, the same approach can be taken by multiplying and adjusting the respective for loops currently used for county. So in summary the code addressess this particular situation but could be easily modified for a more complex election structure on both sides: candidates and geography.
